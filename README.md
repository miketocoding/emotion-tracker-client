# Emotion Tracker: Feel your feels

My project idea is to build an emotion tracker app. Growing up, I feel like my generation was taught to hide or shy away from our emotions and that they were bad. It was more important that we fit in with masculine/feminine, child/adult stereotypes than expressing what we really felt. I want children, specifically, to feel their emotions and understand that all emotions are to be heard and that they don't make us weak but empower us. Target audience would be 4 years and older. If we can normalize feelings and expressions at a younger age, the next generation can grow to be much healthier and more intune with their selves.
